## User story

As a visually impaired entrepreneur, I want to be able to browse the website of my chosen sub contractor so that I can better understand the services they offer.
As an entrepreneur, I frequently sub contract web developers to build functional user interfaces for the projects I am working on. This is not a straightforward task for a visually impaired user, so a website with a high standard of accessibility options is of utmost importance.
An intuitive and easy to navigate website, enormously improves my productivity therefore adding more value to my project as a whole.
